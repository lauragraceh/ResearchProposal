    <h1> Our Relationships to Public Art in an Online Space </h1>
    <h2> An Introduction To This Project </h2>
    <p> I am examining the issue of how public art exists in a digital space, and how we interact with it in that space.
      This topic falls under the generatilized area of art history and anthropology. It is important to this general area because, by accounting for social media/digital spaces, 
     it acts as an update to existing theories about public art. </p>

For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
