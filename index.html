    <h1> Our Relationships to Public Art in an Online Space </h1>
    <h2> An Introduction To This Project </h2>
    <p> I am examining the issue of how public art exists in a digital space, and how we interact with it in that space.
      This topic falls under the generatilized area of art history and anthropology. </p>
    <p> It is important to this general area because, by accounting for social media/digital spaces, 
     it acts as an update to existing theories about public art. </p>
